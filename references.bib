how species composition varies across sites,
and whether these differences can be explained by environmental covariates, treatments and so on

Model-based methods provide a data-generating
process and consequently a likelihood function that can be
tailored to match the ecological processes and questions of
interest. This is in contrast to distance-based methods, which
focus more on describing the multivariate geometry of the
data.

Without
covariates, we can fit pure latent variable models in which species are regressed against a set of unknown covariates, leading
to unconstrained ordination for visualizing site and species
patterns. With covariates, we can fit correlated response models that combine separate species generalized linear models
with latent variables to account for residual correlation, for
example due to biotic interactions, missing covariates. This
facilitates community-level inference about environmental
covariates and treatments while controlling for extraneous correlation between species, as well as providing a method of
`residual ordination'; },

@article{HuiEtAl15,
	Annote = {Methods of unconstrained ordination currently used, such as non-metric multidimensional scaling, are algo-rithm-based techniques developed and implemented withoutdirectly accommodating the statistical properties ofthe data at hand. Failure to account for these key data properties can lead to misleading results.

In this study, we con-sider ordinations using the response data alone, withoutinput from predictor (or `environmental') variables. This isoftenreferredtoasunconstrained ordination

By far, the most common method of unconstrained ordina-tion in ecology is non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS,Kruskal , 1964a, b), an algorithm-based technique which itera-tively repositions points until the relative distances in theordination have the strongest possible monotonic fit to thepairwise dissimilarities between sites, as computed using somedissimilarity measure of the (possibly transformed) data. Arelated method, known as principal coordinate analysis(PCoA, Gower 1966), constructs an ordination by applying asingular value decomposition to a pre-prepared matrix ofapri-oripairwise dissimilarities. PCoA forms the basis for a numberof multivariate methods currently used in ecology (Legendre &Anderson 1999; Anderson 2001; Anderson & Willis 2003), allof which can be understood as fitting linear models to principalcoordinates. One particular choice of PCoA is correspondenceanalysis (CA, Hill 1974), which can be understood as PCoAusing the chi-squared dissimilarity measure along with somepre-specified scaling of site and/or species totals

All of these methods are algorithm-based techniques to ordina-tion, in that they process the data in a series of steps (an algo-rithm) to extract meaning without reference to someunderlying statistical model.


In eqn (1), the termbjaccounts for the differences in mean(and hence variance) across species, due to their different abun-dance (or for presence/absence data, their different species rela-tive frequency). This is what standardizing variables in nMDSattempts to do.

Whether or not the site effects should be included in themodel separately or subsumed into the ordinations dependsto some extent on the ecological question of interest. Inparticular, it depends on whether compositional changealone is of interest or changes in total abundance (speciesrichness) also

The mixture model (MM) approach of Pledger & Arnold(2014) produces an ordination indirectly by classifying species.Here, we propose an alternative to model-based ordinationwhich directly captures the position of sites along some under-lying ecological gradient.

we assume a knownmean--variance relationship

Conditional on the (unknown) latentvariables, the model is a GLM, assuming that species arelinearly related to the underlying latent variables.

Treating the site effects as random has the advantage ofreducing the number of model parameters, so that it would notincrease as sample size increases.

In the LVM formulation above, the inclusion of both siteaiand speciesbjeffects ensures the ordination coordinatesziarestandardized for site total abundance and species prevalence,

Sitesare assumed to be normally distributed along the gradient, andspecies are assumed to be linearly related to position along thisgradient, although as previously mentioned the method isrobust to violation of these assumptions

	Annote = {factorial experiment on fungus

Co‐occurrence patterns were estimated via latent‐variable Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods using the boral package in R (Hui 2016). This approach partitions pairwise associations into an environmental‐based component, which reflects shared responses to environmental gradients, and a residual component, which captures unmeasured species relationships after accounting for environmental conditions (Warton et al. 2015).

This community‐level co‐occurrence metric was first calculated using the residual correlation matrix, which is referred to as the proportion of ``biotic'' positive associations. This same process was then repeated using the environmental correlation matrix, yielding an estimate of the proportion of species with shared environmental preferences (referred to as ``abiotic'' associations).},

@article{InoueEtAl17,
	Annote = {We used joint species distribution models (JSDMs) to investigate the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors that are responsible for the distribution and co‐occurrence of species in riverine ecosystems.

Because correlation between species co‐occurrence can be due to species' abiotic responses and/or other residual correlations (e.g. unknown abiotic variables, biotic interactions; Warton et al., 2015), the latent variables in the CRM can be interpreted as variables accounting for any residual covariation not explained by the abiotic covariates (Hui, 2016).

First, we used species occurrence data only to fit a LVM with two latent variables and constructed an unconstrained biplot to visualize site and species patterns. We then added abiotic covariates in a CRM to construct a residual biplot after controlling for the effect of abiotic variables. From the CRM, we also examined the sign and the strength of significant correlations between species co‐occurrence due to abiotic response and the residual correlations, as based on the 95% credible intervals excluding zero. Furthermore, by taking a proportional difference in the trace of the estimated residual covariate matrix between the LVM and CRM, we determined how much of species co‐occurrence is explained by abiotic covariates },

Initially, we explored the response of benthic habitats to turbidity using Bayesian ordination and re -
gression analysis (Hui et al. 2015). Bayesian ordination is a multivariate ordination technique that allows
for response variables that are not normally distributed and also allows for the inclusion of fixed effects
that constrain the ordination. Thus, we can quantify
the response of benthic groups to turbidity directly,
while accounting for unexplained corre lations in the
cover of benthic groups. 

We also fit a
latent variable model without turbidity, so we could
estimate the amount of covariation in benthic cover
that is explained by turbidity. },
